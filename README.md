# ANPR-Automatic-number-plate-recognition-
This repository is a project based on automatic number plate recognition. 

There are 3 main subproblems in an ANPR
1. Number plate detection
2. Number plate segmentation
3. Number plate recognition

For Detection I have used YOLO V3</br>
</br>
For Segmentation I have used histogram of pixel projection that consists of finding the upper and lower limits as well as left and right of each character.</br>
</br>
For recognition I have used Multi layered perceptron(MLP) Artificial neural nets(ANN).</br>
</br>
Thank you!
